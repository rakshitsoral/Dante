        <p>For more than 4 years now, I have tried multiple-roles in Digital marketing, from SEO to running scalable content marketing campaigns. On this fast and mind-blowing journey, I have switched places, made many friends, learned many things over the years, and I am grateful for that. At this moment, the journey has brought me to Simform in Ahmedabad, Gujarat where I am associated as a campaign manager. As the part of my work, I launched microsites, ran content-marketing/ paid campaigns, explored a few tactics of promotions and marketing. With a goal of pushing boundaries in Marketing, I have even worked for some local clients and helped them increase the online visibility of their business.</p>

        <h2>What does my “day-to-day work experience” Look Like?</h2>
        <p>My work experience has offered me a fantastic opportunity to learn, experiment, and refine my craft in the process. Working in both B2B and B2C industries, I’ve build dynamic and static websites using wordpress, webflow and static site generators (jekyll and hugo) respectively, performed Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to generate organic traffic, implemented relevant CTAs to generate leads, and developed value-adding email marketing strategies to help nurture them.</p>
        <p>Researching buyers persona, creating valuable content, and impactful marketing campaigns are important marketing skills for me. As a Digital Marketer, I possess skills like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>📣 SEO:</strong> Increase website's visibility organically by implementing SEO tactics that include on-page, off-page, technical SEO.</li>

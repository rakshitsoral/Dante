         <p>For the past 10+ years, I’ve built and scaled omni-channel demand generation engines for B2B SaaS companies, using a mix of ABM, cold outbound, and revenue-focused content strategies to turn lead flow from a drip into a steady stream.

I’ve seen how wasted ad spend and inconsistent lead quality can stall growth and drain budgets. That’s why I focus on building systems that align marketing with revenue—optimizing ad spend for real ROAS, leveraging AI and CRM tools to streamline operations, and ensuring every campaign moves the needle.

My experience spans scaling GTM strategy from 0–1, building and leading high-performing marketing teams, and executing campaigns that convert interest into closed revenue. From SEM, paid social, and ABM to content-led pipeline generation, I bring a structured yet adaptable approach to demand generation.</p>

        <p>Along the way, I’ve worked with B2B SaaS and tech companies, led high-performing teams, and consulted for local and international clients to help them increase demand for their products and services. This journey has taken me through building websites, running targeted paid campaigns across LinkedIn, Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and launching email strategies that nurture leads into customers.

Each day, I focus on researching buyer personas, creating content that people actually want to read, and building marketing campaigns that convert interest into revenue. I enjoy testing, refining, and pushing the boundaries of what marketing can do when aligned with business goals.

My goal is simple: to turn marketing from chaos into a predictable system that fuels growth.</p>
